## correlaid_hackathon_spatialdata_mobility_challenge

This repository contains some content my team and I created while hackathon organized by CorrelAid in collaboration with City Interaction Lab. Some ideas/approaches are refactored or added retrospectively.

Further information on *challenges* and *data* can be found in the [official description](https://pad.correlaid.org/mpEjql7hQDu39-iKt6IE3Q#) or this [github repository](https://github.com/jasmincl/correlaid-hackathon-spatialdata).
